# TournamentHelper

-This program's purpose is to help Tournament Organizers to change names and scores  
-It creates 4 text files(p1Name and p2Name, p1Score and p2Score) that can be read by the streaming software  
-Simply enter the players' names , hit apply and control the score with the '+' buttons  
-Once the set is over, you can enter new names, hit apply and press the 'reset scores' button  
-The 'swap sides' button exists for games where lobbies can sometimes randomly switch players around and switches names and scores to correct that
